# JCompactor
JCompactor is a tool that compacts JSON files.

⚠️ I stopped maintaing this repo, so I can give ownership if you want to continue maintaing ⚠️

With the new update, new test shows ,which I made with one of the Minecraft mod, that JCompacter can reduce approximately 1/7 of total JSON size.

:heavy_check_mark: The problem with the non-ascii or non-latin languages solved. There is no problem with them anymore. :heavy_check_mark:

:clipboard: My next plan is fixing json list loading.

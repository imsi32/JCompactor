# JCompactor
JCompactor is a tool that compacts JSON files.

---

A test ,which I made with one of the Minecraft mod, shows that JCompacter can reduce approximately 1/13 of total JSON size.

:warning: However, while non-latic languages json files were comprasing, their size was increasing and the file was **broken**! :warning:
